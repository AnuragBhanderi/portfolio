        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            <b><h2>Hi, Iâ€™m Anurag Bhanderi.</h2></b>
            <br>Iâ€™m a Software Developer with a strong foundation in computer science and hands-on experience in full-stack web and mobile application development. Currently, I am pursuing my Master of Science in Computer Science at The University of Texas at Arlington.
            <br>I have experience working with modern technologies like React, Next.js, Node.js, Flutter, AWS, TensorFlow, and MongoDB. My projects range from AI-powered sentiment analysis platforms to IoT-based attendance systems, demonstrating my ability to create innovative solutions.
            <br>When Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and enhancing my problem-solving skills.
